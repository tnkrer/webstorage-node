[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/webstorage-node.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webstorage-node)

A drop-in localStorage and sessionStorage implementation for browserless 
Node.js environments. 

It is suited for browserless testing environments and use cases with
basic session-scoped and persistent storage requirements.


## Usage

### Getting Started
Install the package using either npm or yarn, saving it to your project.
```sh
npm install webstorage-node --save
```

And then import the module into your project like so.
```js
// With ES2015/ES6
import {localStorage, sessionStorage} from "webstorage-node";

// With CommonJS
const localStorage = require("webstorage-node").localStorage;
const sessionStorage = require("webstorage-node").sessionStorage;
```

### Interacting with the Web Storage API
This library aims to stay as close as possible to the
Web Storage API specification, as defined in the HTML Living Standard.
You can read more about this specification on the 
[WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html) website.

All storage interaction methods supported by 
[`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
and [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
in browser implementations should also work with this
library. The only exception is the 
[`StorageEvent`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-storageevent-interface) interface, as this library
is not intended to fully replace browser implementations.

Here is an example of some trivial CRUD operations using `localStorage`.
```js
// Setting
localStorage.setItem("mykey", "myvalue");
localStorage["mykey] = "myvalue;

// Getting
const x = localStorage.getItem("mykey");
const y = localStorage["mykey"];

// Deletion
localStorage.deleteItem("mykey");
delete localStorage["mykey"];

// Clearing
localStorage.clear();
```
